Hi, I’m Adrián Bolonio, a Senior Software Engineer with a passion on making technology accessible for everyone. I like using and designing systems and interfaces that remove barriers and create a seamless online experience for all users. I bring years of expertise in frontend engineering and accessibility, plus hands-on experience as engineering manager guiding teams toward more inclusive digital solutions. Remote work has allowed me to connect with teams from all over, which keeps me inspired and open to new perspectives.

Outside of work, I’m an avid gamer, love experimenting in the kitchen, and always look forward to my next travel adventure.

I write posts about frontend and web accessibility in [my blog](http://adrianbolonio.com/en/blog), and give talks about accessibility at conferences. You can find [my speaker experience](http://adrianbolonio.com/en/talks) in my website.
