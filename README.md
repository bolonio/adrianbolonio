Hi, my name is Adrián Bolonio. I currently work as an Accessibility Software Engineer working on making the Internet a better and more accessible place for everyone.

When I’m not at the office I enjoy a good read, working my way through any delicious recipe, or indulging my love for travelling to new places.

I write posts about frontend and web accessibility in [my blog](http://adrianbolonio.com/en/blog), and give talks about accessibility at conferences. You can find [my speaker experience](http://adrianbolonio.com/en/talks) in my website.

You can find me in [my website](http://adrianbolonio.com/), [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/adrianbolonio), [my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/bolonio), or you can [send me an email](mailto:adrian.bolonio@gmail.com).
