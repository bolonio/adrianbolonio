title: Testing Web Accessibility
description: When we develop a new web application, we often put a lot of work on the design, on making it beautiful and usable. In other words, we want our web app to be effective, efficient, and satisfying for the user. But a lot of times we donâ€™t think about the user experience for people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments.
