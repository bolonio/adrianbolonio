Hi, thank you very much and we're going to talk about accessibility today um but

first I need to do a disclaimer is a

Pity that I am the last Talk of the day

but this is for any other conference any

other day and forever so if you take a

picture please add the description at

least in Twitter so it's just very funny

to see tweets about how important is

accessibility with no alt so please

don't do that um and let me introduce

myself as well so my name is Adrian I'm

an accessibility software accessibility

software engineer at Mido uh I don't

know if anyone knows Meo or uses um and

you can find me under my surname and my

name uh in Twitter or my

website so I'm gonna picture you a

situation so you are new in a company

and they give you time to take a look at

the code base first so you start taking

a look at the code base and then you

start seeing things that are not really

correct so you there are things that

they are coming that doesn't feel good

so the senior developer comes and say

hey what do you think about our codebase

and say well the application is not very

accessible right and they say what

what's that and then okay you re breath

say okay but do you realize that there

is a lot of work to do I'm going to

picture another situation that is really

based on a true story so again you have

time to take a look at the codebase and

then yeah what do you think about the

codebase and the same well the

application is not very accessible right

and

they can say something like yeah it's

okay we know our customers they are not

blind but you don't have enough

knowledge yet to assess if it's correct

or not so maybe you say well I would

need to trust him because he's the

senior developer he's been here for 10

years so he's not what what he's talking

about and yes I'm using he because

unfortunately that's that's the case

and that is a problem and it could lead

to more problems and the first one is

maybe obvious is the an awareness of the

importance of web accessibility as well

not only the importance but to know what

is web accessibility I think we already

hear a lot about accessibility today

from AE and and and Eva so that's one

problem the other problem could be the

lack of knowledge and Technical

education it could be that we don't know

how to create accessible

code and this could be because there's

not a lot of technical documentation out

there in comparison with the huge amount

of documentation that we have from

JavaScript Frameworks architecture

infrastructure security devops

Etc as well it could be a budget issue

your company maybe don't have the

doesn't have the budget for an

accessibility team or they cannot make

external audits or they don't have

resources like licenses or courses that

they can pay as well the lack of

inclusion of people with disabilities in

development teams we are not ready yet

we don't have the tools to uh for hiring

processes and the communication tools to

include people with disabilities in our

teams so those those are the main

problems that we can find when we when

we're talking about web accessibility in

projects but maybe you can say yeah what

what can I do right so what I'm going to

present today to you is just something

that I've seen that it worked and is a

sustainable strategy so I'm going to

focus in four main pillars and the first

one is planning planning for the future

and you need to start from the personal

commitment you want to be the expert the

key the the key person to be the uh the

yeah the accessibility expert of your

project so make a personal commitment

create your own kpi set the deadline by

the end of the quarter I will be able to

fix issue um easy easy issues on

accessibility I want to finish this

course Etc and important transparency

inform your team and your manager they

need to know that you want to be the one

who's taking the lead in

accessibility as well analyze where are

we now the current situation could be

with an initi audit it doesn't need to

be an external Ling audit we've seen

aore and Eva and we are going to talk

about a bit other other applications

later and involve people with

disabilities from the beginning us ux

research and usability test but it

doesn't need to be organized you can

maybe ask in the internet if someone

want to test your application and then

maybe you have an interview that's that

doesn't need to be formal it could be

informal and then you can find a lot of

feedback from there and inform yourself

about the legality I mean European Act

is in coming in 2025 and you need to be

aware you need to be aware what is the

implications for your company and as

well talk to your managers and

transparency I I always talk about

transparency in 360 if your company

allows it make a public road map or at

least the public progress this is what

we have achieved or this is what we want

to work on in the next months but have

an external contact method leave your

users your customers be able to contact

you and we already seen from an like not

only a phone but an email in a written

form in a voice form any

other as well cultural change and we

always talk about education but I think

we need to include accessibility in our

development processes and this only can

be done by changing our culture our

processes accessibility is everyone's

responsibility we need to have a

transparent vertical talk to your

manager if you're a manager talk to your

employees but as well with your

colleagues in a horizontal way and a

transversal way like talk to other teams

the design team the uh infrastructure

team it affects everyone as well search

and create allies we cannot be in this

alone you need to create a a group of

people that are with you and maybe you

can do you can um do it with an ex

ibility Champion program an

accessibility Champion is a member of

the product team doesn't need to it

doesn't matter if it's a def a PM a

designer and they are applying

principles within their team and they

can be a good connection within with the

accessibility team and maybe you are the

accessibility

expert as well Define rules standards

and policies very clear an accessible

MVP prototype and first iterations MVP

is there is a V and is viable and if

it's not accessible it's not viable it's

just minimum and is a product and the

definition of done it is not if it's not

accessible it's not done it's not done

yet as well internal visibility okay so

you have uh a communication channels

maybe slack maybe Microsoft teams

whatever you're using Create one for

talk to talk about

accessibility inform the the team share

articles Etc but celebrate releases as

well maybe you know that other team has

fixed a lot of issues from an audit

celebrate those releases and give and

ask feedback to other teams hey I am the

accessibility expert we are the

accessibility team how do you want us to

collaborate with you is this is this the

way that you want do you want to have a

um a meeting every week do can we make a

retro to see if we can polish the the

communication do you want us to fix the

issues do you want us to tell you the

issues and then you fix and then we

review the PO

request just ask for it ask for

feedback as well education and Technical

Excellence we talk about changing the

culture and making this cultural change

but we want to be the best developers

the best Engineers we always want the to

to to be able to to apply the best

techniques and to to to have more

knowledge and the initial one the basic

one are everything renders in HTML CSS

and JavaScript the other thing the rest

is just pure grammar you want to write

your HTML CSS and JavaScript in react

that's good angular python uh Jango it

doesn't matter this is grammar this is

the way that you write if everything

renders in those three because those are

the only languages that our browsers

understand and you need to understand

what is the end result otherwise you

could be a very good react

developer but you're not a frontend

developer so let's let's refresh our

bases you need to understand what is the

w3c what is semantic web who is setting

those standards that we are applying and

as well yeah use courses conferences

doesn't need to be paid there are a lot

of free ones and we are in a conference

so attend if your company allows it to

to do it or this conference is free if

you is in Virtual way so you're watching

from home or YouTube later then do it

and the community just try to follow on

Twitter on any other platform um people

who are sharing the knowledge about the

topic that you want in this case

accessibility quick RS there is a scale

on effort versus impact and we want to

look for the the minimum effort for the

biggest impact so I want to tell you

about the most common wag failures in 1

million

websites and surprisedly or nons

surprisedly the the M the most the six

most most common

failures has been the same for the last

five years so let's make a game here and

the last one we have missing document

language okay so language is the

attribute that you need to put in the

HTML tag and that allows the screen

readers to adapt the grammar set to read

the website in a correct

way we have empty buttons empty buttons

can be a floppy dis that there's a

button with an icon there's no text so

maybe we want to add an area label to

give more

context the next one is missing form

input labels remember placeholders are

not labels every input in every form to

have a

label visible and if it doesn't have a

label a visible label then it needs to

have an area label so it needs to be an

IT need to have an accessible

name empty links the typical empty links

are the link to your Twitter profile

which is just the icon of Twitter the

link to your Instagram account that is

only the Instagram logo those are empty

links who has no content again and adiel

able to give more context about

it missing alt text for images we are

not disc describing the images that we

put in the website it doesn't matter as

well in the website in web apps social

network Etc Instagram Twitter any other

uh social network have um the ability to

add descriptions to the web to the

images I I already made the disclaimer

before use it because otherwise you're

gonna make a tweet to say look how cool

is that for someone who is blind then

that means nothing so this one and I

will let you figure out what is the top

one uh most common error anyone want to

guess uh maybe s a bit

more

anyone color color contrast 80 almost

85% of all websites and this is done in

1 million but it's a good amount almost

85% of all webs have contrast

problems it is very easy you just need

to compare two colors there's a lot of

um um engines comparison websites that

you can use uh this survey is done by

web aim and web aim has their own one

you just need to put the two Tech the

two colors and they will give you a

radio and even they will give you a

green titig or red cross just go with

the with the green take and the contrast

is the contract between the text and the

background where the text is going to be

located for example a button so the

background of the button and the color

of the text so those are very quick wins

that we can we can apply it's very low

impact so very low uh effort with a high

impact and it could be a couple of lines

of

code and share your knowledge again and

going again with transparency use this

accessibility channel to share the

knowledge that you have article Etc or

maybe you have a front end Guild and you

want to make a talk about it or internal

Events maybe you want to do a internal

Meetup only to talk about accessibility

or front end and create a post or a

video if your company has a tech blog or

your own blog or only internally in your

Wiki just create their documentation so

the one who's going to come after you

they can read what you have researched

what you have found then they can take

out from

there as well we need to have a good

observability and alerting system so

it's very important that we test with

manual and simulation test and what do I

mean with manual simulation tests for

example we have external things like

this is a pair of glasses that simulates

visual deficiencies and yeah you can see

that you don't find the focus or the

button that is not clickable with the

keyboard and you're starting to get

angry and then at the end you very angry

because you cannot use the

website so you use screen readers to

hear what it is in the screen or you use

only the Tab Key you don't you don't

want some people don't use this the

mouse so try to navigate you only using

your keyboard or maybe you want to use

extensions in the browser uh we see a

lot of simulations for uh color

deficiencies or just visual

deficiencies and external simulators

like those pair of glasses that I've

seen you

before as well automate test unit test

and end to end test uh Eva so aore I

will give you a bit more P11 Y is

another good engine use linters there is

uh axe linter for access ility inter

linter for TSL and Es lint do your unit

test and do end to test and include them

into the your

cicd with this one we are going to avoid

putting inaccessible code in production

we are going to be we we're going to be

able to stop it there and if you have it

uh in GitHub with GitHub actions for

example you can see them directly in

your P requests is very very

easy I talk about testing web

accessibility before in a talk and I

wrote about it in my blog so if you want

to take a look just feel free and and

give it a

look and as well the Three A's right we

found errors well that's good but we

need to study them let's assess them

let's analyze them and let's act about

it but always take decisions based on

their

results you want to be able to say how

many images of your website has alt or

not that's good but we need to analyze

as well the quality of the description

of the images and based on the results

we can say okay we want to improve we

are happy with the result Etc and

documented again for someone who's

coming after

afterwards some work is already done and

that's very very beneficial in sh the

results we already talking about the

accessibility channel the front thing

Guild make a talk about the testing

phase the the applications that you

using in your cicd and Y

documented so those are the four pillars

that I've seen that it worked and at

least in the teams that I've been

working on and I think is a very good

starting point to build maybe not an

accessibility team but an accessibility

culture strategy and from there you can

always build on

top so before I was talking about a

situation where you are new in a company

and then you find out that the

application the website is not

accessible and then your other

colleagues your developer the your

colleague developer say well either I

don't know what that is

or we know our our our users so it's

pretty much an awareness and

denying so let me picture the ideal

situation so again you arrived to the

company but you are already six months

one year in the company and then your

colleague said well thank you for your

poor request improving the accessibility

of the product it's very cool now we

have a very good vpad that we can

publish we share already the

documentation within the team we make uh

post about it that's very cool and then

you can even go a bit further like I'm

glad and I added unit tests and end to n

test uh with A and P Y and I added to CI

to our cicd so we can be sure 100% sure

that the code that we produce is not

going to production

and we are going to capture within our

processes and then well your call say

yeah that's great why don't you prepare

a talk why don't you share about it with

us we are very excited about it and we

have a frontend guild meeting next week

so share with us maybe you want to say

yeah again I'm GNA go further and I was

actually thinking of writing a blog post

or a call for paper for a talk in a

conference and share with the community

so like this we have included the

cultural change in our colleagues we

have the education education and Tech

Excellence because we are the one doing

it but a poor request apart from being a

request is as well a method to learn

from your colleagues we are transparency

we we are sharing it within the team and

thinking about writing a blog post in

the community so you are as well put

putting

yourself visible for the rest of the

community and as well we have a good

system in cicd we create a unit test we

have uh endtoend test and we know how to

read those test we know how to read

those uh results create documentation

and act based on those

facts and this is because

accessibility is not a feature it it

cannot be a feature and it will never be

we cannot treat it as a postprocess

because I've always remembered that uh

one of the software Architects that I

that I work with the the he always use a

sentence called later never happens and

we are very very often say yeah we will

do it later but trust me L later never

happens and it doesn't cost more time

it's going to take you 10 seconds to

write an area label 10 seconds to uh put

a role in an element so try to include

accessibility in your um development

process but is some there is

something that we always forget and not

only forget that we sometimes we have

the misconception and is we don't

develop digital products for the

companies that we work for we

development for other humans the company

that we work for is only a channel to

arrive to those humans so let's use them

let's work for them but think about the

end user since we don't know our users

and if someone said you know your users

is wrong because you never know who's

going to use your application maybe I'm

showing it to a friend maybe I'm using

it with my family you don't know your

users and since you don't know them the

only way that you have to create a

quality

product is creating a product for

everyone and if you start thinking on

the end human that is going to use your

application and you put yourself in the

skin and the shoes of someone else then

you're starting to create that cultural

change as well in yourself and we we are

we are going in the in the good

direction

and that's

it
